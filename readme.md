# sitelen pona pona

This concept (and embedded font) adapts [sitelen pona](http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/hieroglyphs.php) into a unicode-based script that can be typed or written, and attempts to tackle the following goals:

* remove redundant information from glyphs
* use a consistent shape inventory
* fit glyphs onto a baseline, descending or ascending when appropriate
* make glyphs easy to differentiate at small sizes
* align with standard Latin punctuation and text (can be used inline)

[The font can be downloaded from the releases page](https://github.com/jackhumbert/sitelen-pona-pona/releases), and [the full write-up/demo is hosted here](https://jackhumbert.github.io/sitelen-pona-pona/).
